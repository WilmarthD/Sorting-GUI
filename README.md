# Sorting-GUI
GUI application containing a menu and action-enabled buttons

## Setup
> Download all .java files into the same program folder

> Download or follow the .txt files, these are input file examples

> Build the program and run from the command line, argument 1 will be the name of the sort file and argument 2 will be the name of the search file

## The program
> First, access the menu at the top left of the window. When clicked, three options will appear
> - Read sort file: This will read in all of the values from the sort file
> - Read search file: This will read in all of the values from the search file
> - Exit: This will safely close the program
> - When clicking any of these options, it will output a message in the console to show it was successful 

> Next, click any of the buttons on the left hand side. These will place the sort values into the datatype stated by that button's label
> - When pressed, the output will show how long the action took in milliseconds 

> Buttons on the right side only active if the search file was read in (via the menu) and the values are read into that datatype (via the adjacent left button)
> - These will search the datasets with each value in the search file
> - The output will show the amount of values found toward the left and how long it took on the right
